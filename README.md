<h1> MyKeyboardWebApp </h1>

I made this for my MU2300 final project at WPI. It utilizes the Webaudio API to generate tones on the browser. I utilzed my 'adept' javascript skills to create a react app capable of handling the basic functionality of a keyboard and scale-player. 

If you think of any features (any suggestions really) please email me at Rileypatblair@gmail.com!
